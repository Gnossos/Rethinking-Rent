@incollection{jakab_property_2015,
	Abstract = {In ancient societies, ownership or other types of control over agrarian land played an essential role in the wealth and growth of individuals and of the whole community. Legal institutions interacted in the allocation of natural resources. Therefore the definition of property rights and other types of interest in land attracted intense scrutiny. In the nineteenth century, legal theory created the myth of absolute, exclusive, and unbounded individual ownership, which seemingly had its roots in classical Roman law. The chapter shows that such ownership was never an abstract, unlimited right in ancient Rome. Ownership was rather a dynamic category with changing legal content according to its social, political, and economic environment. It met a broader target, and fostered conditions amenable to an optimal exploitation of the main natural resource, agrarian land.},

@article{williams_leasing_2011,
	Abstract = {A fresh examination of six inscribed fragments (Agora {XIX} L6 a--f ) previously attributed to the first of a series of stelai recording civic leases of sacred land in late-4th-century Athens reveals that they belong to four separate stelai, only one of which can be dated to 343/2 b.c. The publication of the leases was linked to a reorganization of sacred finances that included the amalgamation
of the treasuries of Athena and the Other Gods, ca. 346/5. The new reconstruction challenges previous estimates of the extent of Athenian sacred property and the assumption that subsequent lists (Agora {XIX} L9--12, L14)
were produced only at 10-year intervals.},

@article{sheppard2011geographical,
	Abstract = {The line of scholarship dominating Anglophone geographers' approaches to studying economic geography since 1980 can be characterized as geographical political economy; an approach prioritizing commodity production over market exchange. Here the spatialities of capitalism co-evolve with its economic processes and economic, political, cultural and biophysical processes are co-implicated with one another. Disequilibrium is normal and space/time an emergent feature. This approach is very different from geographical economics. Mutual engagement is desirable and most easily approached via the geographical sub-field of regional political economy. Regional political economy demonstrates that capitalism's spatialities increase agents' uncertainty and the likelihood of unintended consequences, that microfoundations are inadequate, and that capitalism is generative of economic inequality and uneven geographical development. The scope of geographical political economy is illustrated by the geography of commodity production.},

Those grounds, the article argues, are tenuous. And, far from disabling us, treating land as no more or less real than other forms of capital and commodity can empower us in productively revisiting and centring the question of land's political economy \textendash{} a crucial undertaking in a world where the materiality of land to social relations is writ increasingly large.},

@article{elden2010landterrain,
	Abstract = {This paper outlines a way toward conceptual and historical clarity around the question of territory. The aim is not to define territory, in the sense of a single meaning; but rather to indicate the issues at stake in grasping how it has been understood in different historical and geographical contexts. It does so first by critically interrogating work on territoriality, suggesting that neither the biological nor the social uses of this term are particularly profitable ways to approach the historically more specific category of `territory'. Instead, ideas of `land' and `terrain' are examined, suggesting that these political-economic and political-strategic relations are essential to understanding `territory', yet ultimately insufficient. Territory needs to be understood in terms of its relation to space, itself a calculative category that is dependent on the existence of a range of techniques. Ultimately this requires rethinking unproblematic definitions of territory as a `bounded space' or the state as a `bordered power container', because both presuppose the two things that should be most interrogated, space and boundaries. Rather than boundaries being the distinction between place and space, or land or terrain and territory, boundaries are a second-order problem founded upon a particular sense of calculation and concomitant grasp of space. Territory then can be understood as a political technology: it comprises techniques for measuring land and controlling terrain, and measure and control \textemdash{} the technical and the legal \textemdash{} must be thought alongside the economic and strategic.},

@article{anderson2014classmonopoly,
	Abstract = {The objective of this essay is to rejuvenate interest in Marxian rent theory in urban political economy by identifying and deepening discussion of an important aspect of the contemporary neoliberal city: class monopoly rent. First introduced by David Harvey, the concept of class monopoly rent has curiously evaded in-depth scholarly inquiry and has never been substantively elaborated or examined. But the conditions through which class monopoly rents are extracted from property have since evolved. Yet, we know little about the relation between this standard institutional practice and contemporary urban landscapes, modes of governance, and processes of urban restructuring. The essay first reviews and identifies the concept of class monopoly rent as an important aspect of the urban process and discusses its limited scholarly engagement over the past four decades. It then discusses the implications of class monopoly rent in the context of current urban redevelopment policies and practices in Chicago, Illinois. It is suggested that a deeper examination of this concept could build a more robust and intricate understanding of the contemporary neoliberal city, particularly in the context of the post-2007 economic recession.},

@article{park2014landrent,
	Abstract = {In explaining the causes of the global economic crisis that was ignited by the bubble bust in the housing market in 2008, mainstream economics hardly provides any fundamental explanation for the fluctuation of house prices, other than criticizing the operation of the financial markets. Although land rent lies at the center of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the movement of house prices, little attention has been paid to it. Land rent theory was in the limelight as an alternative to mainstream urban economics in the 1970s-80s. However, it has completely lost its status as an alternative in housing market analysis. The reasons for this decline may be found by reviewing the contributions of land rent theory. The revival of the theory is urgently required as a convincing alternative in the understanding of housing markets. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

@article{haila1990thetheory,
	Abstract = {A critical survey is offered of various recent positions in the theory of land rent. An attempt is made to strip rent discourse of those peculiarities that have alienated some of its potential audience, thereby turning the theory into the esoteric property of an academic coterie. The discussion of the last fifteen years is divided into three phases, namely consensus (in the 1970s), transition (at the turn of the decade), and rupture (in the 1980s). The typical beliefs, claims, and tenets of each phase are reconstructed and discussed, and the transition from one phase to another is analyzed. In order to facilitate and incite further discussion the present, that is third, phase is purposefully construed in terms of two rival lines of thought: the idiographic line (that denies the possibility of a general theory of land rent, advocating instead the analysis of concrete situations), and the nomothetic line (that searches for general laws). The first line is rejected in favour of the second.},

The bulk of the book is dedicated to Thompson's famous polemic against Louis Althusser and what he considers the reductionism and authoritarianism of Althusserian structuralism. In lively and erudite prose, Thompson argues for a self-critical and unapologetically humanist Marxist tradition. Also included are three essays of considerable importance to the development of the New Left. Also available from Monthly Review Press: E.P. Thompson and the Making of the New Left: Essays and Polemics, edited by Cal Winslow E. P. Thompson (1924-1993) is among the most acclaimed historians of the twentieth century. He is known for his works The Making of the English Working Class, William Morris, and The Poverty of Theory, among others.},

	Abstract = {In dialogue with Ray Hudson's paper on `rising powers' in globalizing capitalism, this review article reflects on the position and priority of these macroscopic questions in the field of economic geography, focusing in particular on the prospects for a reanimated political economy of uneven spatial development. Two themes are explored. First, the paper asks what it means to confront the problematic of rising (and falling) capitalisms, and why it is that the vocabulary for this discussion has to be imported, if not improvised. Second, it explores what it might mean not just to revisit and re(in)state, but to reconstruct notions of uneven spatial development, which despite their virtually uncontestable status in the field of economic geography have in practice often been allowed recede into the explanatory background, either as an implicit ontological precondition or as little more than an ambient sensibility.},

@article{hudson2016risingpowers,
	Abstract = {The emergence of the rising powers has been seen as heralding a fundamental shift in global economic geography. It can also be seen as the latest expression of capitalist economic development. I first consider theorizations of this development as combined, uneven and crisis-prone, with an ongoing tension between processes of differentiation and equalization. I then situate the rising powers in the context of successive patterns of global uneven development, the transformation from an Old to a New International Division of Labour and then to a `new' New International Division of Labour in which the emergence of the rising powers is a major element. There are, however, significant differences among the rising powers in their economic development trajectories, in the role of the state in shaping these, and in their relationships to other economies in both global North and South. Changes at the global scale are linked to changes in the intra-national geographies of economies in the new global economic geography. I conclude with some speculative remarks as to the possible future trajectories of the rising powers and how global economic geographies might evolve in future.},

@article{li2014whatis,
	Abstract = {The so-called global land rush has drawn new attention to land, its uses and value. But land is a strange object. Although it is often treated as a thing and sometimes as a commodity, it is not like a mat: you cannot roll it up and take it away. To turn it to productive use requires regimes of exclusion that distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses and users, and the inscribing of boundaries through devices such as fences, title deeds, laws, zones, regulations, landmarks and story-lines. Its very `resourceness' is not an intrinsic or natural quality. It is an assemblage of materialities, relations, technologies and discourses that have to be pulled together and made to align. To render it investible, more work is needed. This Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers Plenary Lecture uses an analytic of assemblage to examine the practices that make up land as a resource. It focuses especially on the `statistical picturing' devices and other graphic forms that make large-scale investments in land thinkable, and the practices through which relevant actors (experts, investors, villagers, governments) are enrolled. It also considers some of the risks that follow when these large-scale investments land in particular places, as land they must.},

@thesis{park2011spatial,
	Abstract = {This study adopts Marxian land rent theory as a framework to understand the structure of house prices with explicit attention to labour reproduction in an urban context. It attempts to correct the misunderstandings in Marxian land rent theory and develop it for an urban context. The four categories of land rent of differential rent, differential rent 2, absolute rent, and monopoly rent are critically re-examined. Subsequently, the combination of absolute rent and differential rent is suggested as a general structure for land rents in an urban context. The dynamic mechanism of changes in land rents is explained with the concepts of emulation, differentiation and shift between groups of houses based on the structure of land rents. The process of the formation of housing submarkets has been examined for a practical preparation for empirical analysis and a theoretical basis for the subdivision of the housing market. Spatial submarkets are identified by focusing on the interactive relationship between residential spheres (a unit consisting of a centre of employment and the surrounding residential area). Sectoral submarkets are defined based on social and environmental features as well as the structural features of dwellings. For empirical analysis, three metropolitan cities were chosen: London as monocentric, Seoul as tri-centric and Los Angeles as polycentric. Empirical analysis has used commuting patterns and the contours of house prices as the criteria to identify spatial submarkets with the help of network analysis and GIS. Simple OLS regression analysis of house prices on the accessibility to centre was conducted in each identified submarket. The results were used to explore the structure of and the dynamic changes in land rents. A consistent structure of land rents was observed in each housing submarket across all three cities. The implication on the condition of labour reproduction was drawn out by interpreting the changes in land rents over a period of 10 years in each city. The analysis of London revealed a monocentric housing market structure and the suitability of commuting time over physical distance as an accessibility variable. In Seoul``s case, the transition from tri-centric to monocentric housing market was observed and a comparative approach with rent and price data enriched the interpretation of the changes in the structure of the housing market. The impact of social and environmental features of the neighbourhood, such as class, ethnic concentration and negative externality, on house prices was highlighted in the analysis of Los Angeles.},

@unpublished{birch2017technoscience,
	Abstract = {Increasingly, a range of `things' (e.g. infrastructure, data, knowledge, bodies, etc.) are configured and/or reconfigured as assets, or capitalized property. Accumulation strategies have changed as a result of this assetization process, which characterizes a particular form of technoscientific capitalism. Rather than entrepreneurial strategies based on commodity production, technoscientific capitalism is increasingly underpinned by rentiership, or the appropriation of value through ownership rights (e.g. intellectual property), monopoly conditions, and regulatory or market devices and practices (e.g. investment dispute courts, exclusivity agreements, etc.). While rentiership and rent-seeking are often presented as negative phenomena (e.g. distorting markets, unearned income) in both neoclassical and Marxist literatures -- and much in-between --it is my intention in this paper to unpack rentiership as an increasingly constitutive politicaleconomic process underpinning technoscientific capitalism. Rather than being framed as a problematic `side-effect' of capitalism, I argue that rentiership can help us to understand how different forms of value extraction are constituted by and come to constitute different forms of technoscience. This has significant analytical, political, and normative implications for understanding the relationship between science, innovation, and business (e.g. how do rentier rationales configure research agendas, how does innovation enable rentiership, what are the consequences for social equity, etc.).},

@article{felli2014onclimate,
	Abstract = {As environmental degradation becomes a growing concern, this article argues that the development of international law on climate change expresses the deep social contradictions between accumulation and reproduction under capitalism. These contradictions are translated into the creation of a form of public property over the right to emit greenhouse gases (and not the `privatisation' of the atmosphere). This public property is unequally distributed amongst states in an imperialist manner. The distribution of these rights at the domestic level amounts to the distribution of rights to climate rent. Contrary to popular accounts of the `commodification' of nature, I argue that emission rights are not `commodities', and emissions trading and carbon markets are not `accumulation strategies'. These are merely depoliticised forms in which climate rent is extracted and circulates to preclude political debates about the goals of production.},

@article{andreucci2017valuegrabbing,
	Abstract = {This paper aims to redress the under-appreciated significance of rent for political ecological analysis. We introduce the notion of value grabbing, defined as the appropriation of (surplus) value through rent. A concept that is analytically distinct from accumulation, rent is both a social relation and a distributional process that is increasingly central to the reproduction of contemporary capitalism. Emphasis is placed on the ``grabbing'' of value in order to shed light on the processes at work by which surplus value is distributed unevenly between different classes and fractions of classes. A focus on rent within political ecology, we argue, can help us distinguish between two organically related but analytically distinct ``moments'': (a) the creation of property rights that establish rent relations and (b) the struggle over the appropriation and distribution of surplus value generated by the rent relation itself. We explore some of the implications of this perspective for understanding new forms of socio-ecological struggles and their varied relations to the state. We maintain that a value-grabbing perspective has far-reaching consequences for political ecology, as it provides a sharp conceptual tool for situating a wide range of socio-ecological conflicts and movements as class struggles over value appropriation and distribution.},

@inbook{marx1986themethod,
	Abstract = {The Marx/Engels Collected Works is the largest collection of translations of the complete works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels covering the period 1835-1895.  The 50 volumes contain all the written works of Marx and Engels including formerly unpublished manuscripts and letters. This digital collection gives scholars access to the complete oeuvre in a fully searchable format.

The volumes are organised into three groups: (1) philosophical, historical, political, economic and other works, in chronological order; (2) Marx's Capital with his preliminary versions and works directly connected with it, particularly the Economic Manuscripts of 1857-58, better known under the editorial heading Grundisse der Kritik der Politischen Okonomie ; (3) the letters of Marx and Engels which are extremely rich in theoretical content and provide an indispensable source for the study of the biographies of Marx and Engels. 

The texts in Volumes 28-37 represent the principal stages in the formation of Marx's economic doctrine.  Volumes 28 and 29 contain Marx's Economic Manuscripts of 1857-58 (the first rough draft of Capital) and his work A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy: Part One (1859). Volumes 30-34 comprise the Economic Manuscripts of 1861-63 (the second rough draft of Capital), volumes 35-37 contain volumes I, II and III of Capital.

This volume contains the bulk of the manuscripts of 1857-58 ``Bastiat and Carey'', ``Introduction'' and the greater part of the Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy (better known as the Grundisse) the rest of which appears in Volume 29.},

@thesis{deak1985renttheory,
	Abstract = {This dissertation is the account of an inquiry into the spatial organization in
the modern urban agglomeration, It starts out from the view that 'locatio n' and
'space' acquire a meaning only as a support for economic activities, and conversely,
the economic laws governing production and consumption become incomplete
unless they account from their very inception for the territorial dimension of
the economy. Such reciprocai determination between the 'spatial' and the 'economic'
1is integrated within the urban process through the payment for a location
in the urban space as a necessary condition to all economic activity. This leads
the inquiry to centre upon the price of the land, the form in which the paynent
for location materializes in contemporary capitalism.
A first part of the dissertation deals with a critique of rent theory, in which
land price is seen as the capitalized form of land rent. An historical interpre
tation shows that both society and the economy have been so thoroughly transfor
med since the origins of rent theory in the seventeenth century, that none of
the assumptions of the latter bears any relevance to the modern market economy
of our day. Land price cannot therefore be derived from land rent, and must be
analysed directly as an independent concept in its own right.
The second part develops the concepts of location and space as deriving from the
rise of conmodity production. In particular the analysis of the effect of compe\_
tition on the transformation of the techniques of production is extended to include
the role of location in the latter. Then the price of location becones a
result of the same competition which regulates production and it is incorporated
into the cost-price of commodities. The limits to market regulation are reached,
however, when it comes to production of space itself that cannot be performed
without state intervention. Accordingly, the analysis of the urban process must
explore the limits and the interaction of market regulation and planning in spatial
organization.
The last part deals with the conditions under which the balance between the use
of economic and extra-economic means of regulation is achieved under specific
historical circumstances and regimes of growth. Planning is seen precisely as
the state activity aimed at a co-ordination of the forces of market competition
and the interventions through land use zoning, taxation and public entreprise .
The price of the land becomes the pivot of the articulation of market and state
regulation in spatial organization, an articulation in turn dominated by the
stage of development of the antagonism between corrmodity form and direce produc\_
tion of use values. Thus in the account of the price of the location economic
analysis must be complemented by historical interpretation.},

	Abstract = {The term `Whig interpretation of history' was applied by Herbert Butterfield to a particular current within English historiography, an outstanding characteristic of which was its tendency to praise revolutions provided they had been successful, the particular successes to which he referred being those of Protestants and Whigs over Catholics and Tories. He also acknowledged that his critique `possibly' gave the phrase an `extended sense' applicable to any current in historiography characterised by equivalently crude teleology and decontextualisation. It is with reference to this possible `extended' sense that the phrase has gained currency in critical currents within the history of the natural and social sciences. The present case study of the secondary literature on the English writer William Petty (1623\textendash{}87) argues that, while the two senses are of course conceptually distinct, they are nevertheless very much part of the same story if we are to explain how it has come about that the distortions indicated in the extended sense have become so deeply rooted in the economics mainstream's portrayal of its own history.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACTChina has had very active markets for both the sale and the rental of land since Song times (960--1279), if not longer. By the sixteenth century, most of the institutional arrangements that would characterize these markets until 1949 were in place. These institutions differed sharply from those of emerging land markets in early modern Western Europe: in particular, government played a lesser role in adjudicating disputes over land contracts, and customary arrangements included features that (a) gave some sellers of land claims on purchasers that could last for many years and (b) gave some tenants, especially in South and East China, very strong usufruct rights, which themselves became a form of tradable property. However, despite these and other differences from Western models, Chinese land markets were quite efficient, and provided the incentives needed for a very productive agriculture; secure tenants, for instance, responded to their strong position by behaving like owners and investing heavily in improving the land.},

This, however, was by no means a general and unilinear process, but one that displays strong regional differences and temporal discontinuities. This article aims to gain more insight in the factors underlying these differences, by reconstructing and analysing the institutional organization of exchange in land and lease markets. The analysis, undertaken for northwestern Europe and Italy, points to the socio-political context as a main determinant of this organization.},

@article{Cerman:2008aa,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACTRecent research on the development of peasant land markets and transfer patterns for central and east-central Europe concentrated on the early modern period. For the late Middle Ages, rural history still relies on older approaches studying the general development of `agrarian structure' (Agrarverfassung) and peasant `inheritance'. This article seeks to establish the basis for a more systematic analysis of the formation and general development of peasant land markets in late medieval central and east-central Europe in a comparative perspective. Apart from changes weakening traditional manorial structures, secure peasant property rights of hereditary tenure developed and prevailed by the later Middle Ages. Possible institutional rigidities of transactions with peasant farmland, whose effects in practice would need further exploration, were undermined by the existence of reserves of land situated outside the measured open fields of peasant farms that could be traded more flexibly. These areas also formed important resources for the establishment of smallholders and cottagers who in turn added to the dynamics of developing peasant land markets. In the final section, the article offers a brief survey of developments during the early modern period and concludes that traditional images of an undermining of peasant property rights and of massive landlord powers due to the rise of `demesne lordship' (Gutsherrschaft) must be seriously questioned, as recent empirical studies highlight enormous regional variation and a dominant pattern of continuity of secure peasant property rights and also indicate considerable land mobility.},

	Abstract = {One of the most revealing aspects of any society is the distribution of wealth. In the ancient world, the stratification of landholdings essentially determined the stratification of wealth. There were, to be sure, many other kinds of wealth: funds and commodities for lending, urban rental property, productive enterprises, slaves, ships, and so on. To some extent these were no doubt owned by the same people who owned agricultural land, but the almost total absence of quantifiable data makes generalization difficult. Land, moreover, occupied a unique position in the economy and government of the Roman Empire, both practically and ideologically. The great bulk of taxation fell on the land, and almost all of the burdens of public service both in the cities and in the villages were attached to its ownership. That these disadvantages of land as a form of wealth were insufficient to deter the {\'e}lite from desiring land is in some measure the result of the enormous ideological preference that all of classical antiquity attached to land as a form of wealth, an ideology connected in part to the relative stability of returns from landed property compared to those from other, more volatile, forms of wealth.},

  abstract = {The line of scholarship dominating Anglophone geographers' approaches to studying economic geography since 1980 can be characterized as geographical political economy; an approach prioritizing commodity production over market exchange. Here the spatialities of capitalism co-evolve with its economic processes and economic, political, cultural and biophysical processes are co-implicated with one another. Disequilibrium is normal and space/time an emergent feature. This approach is very different from geographical economics. Mutual engagement is desirable and most easily approached via the geographical sub-field of regional political economy. Regional political economy demonstrates that capitalism's spatialities increase agents' uncertainty and the likelihood of unintended consequences, that microfoundations are inadequate, and that capitalism is generative of economic inequality and uneven geographical development. The scope of geographical political economy is illustrated by the geography of commodity production.},
