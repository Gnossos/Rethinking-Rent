By comparison, commentators on land-rent today are seriously handicapped.
 The subject has been largely neglected for roughly the past twenty-five
 years, and whatever work on land-rent theory has been done recently is
 diffuse and in disarray: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Land rent theory does not have one coherent and widely accepted theoretical
 corpus, but consists of a variety of different conceptualizations, even
 of its central categories

 Beyond the distinction between mainstream, neoclassical economics and heterodox
 approaches, one cannot even identify a small number of competing candidate
 theories for purposes of comparison.
 And certainly a contemporary commentator has no authoritative text equivalent
 to Marshall's 
\emph on
Principles
\emph default
 from which to draw authoritative statements about land rent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nonetheless, several authors have recently written histories of land-rent
 theory, and at least these anglophone histories share much in common.
 Even more than their actual content and details, their approach to the
 history of land-rent theory hardly varies.
 They share a common, and not altogether approbative, historiography.

 In one, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 says, 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

The history of this [land-rent] theory is not a story of progress towards
 a better understanding of land rent but rather an adaptation to emerging
 social problems, like poverty, taxes, speculation, or high land prices.
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 This suggests that land-rent theory has most often developed in a 
\begin_inset Quotes xld
\end_inset

targeted
\begin_inset Quotes xrd
\end_inset

 manner, as discussed above.
 Given that recent histories of land-rent theory claim the subject has been
 neglected for over two decades and is decrepit, these histories can hardly
 be ones of unequivocal scientific progress, in which later developments
 are improvements on earlier ones.
 But neither is the conventional historiography of land rent terribly critical,
 and the common practice of organizing histories chronologically without
 much critical comment creates an underlying sense of theoretical progress
 and positive evolution, or at least one that was unavoidable.
 This practice is so common with land-rent theory that it is even hard to
 imagine alternatives historiographical approaches, such as focusing on
 biography or emphasizing social problems (and conflicts) Haila briefly
 mentions.
 Compare this with the 
\begin_inset Quotes xld

Who are its agents, and what are their behavioral patterns and social relations?

\begin_layout Enumerate
What is rent's economic role?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the conventional historiography these questions have become a common
 device for interpreting and evaluating land-rent theory and for organizing
 historical narratives, either explicitly 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g.,"
key "ward2016theshitty"

\end_inset

 or implicitly 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "e.g., "
key "jager2003urbanland"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 But to cover the entire theoretical landscape, the questions are themselves
 necessarily broad.
 This breadth creates an 
\emph on
illusion
\emph default
 of comprehesiveness, but in fact it makes the questions have a certain
 vagueness, which in turn obscures important omissions and unrecognized
 assumptions.
 For example, the first question covers now-familiar 
\emph on
mechanisms
\emph default
 by which rent comes into existence – differential rent, absolute rent,
 etc., but taken literally it also covers long geo-historical processes such
 as how the Roman practice of compensating soldiers with land, eventually
 providing the basis for feudal landownership and rent

\end_inset

.
 Yet considerations of this second sort are completely missing from the
 conventional historiography.
 Similarly, the third question covers the entirerty of economic ramifications
 of rent, but in actual practice the conventional historiography reduces
 this to rather narrow economic functions, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coordination,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which themselves are often under-theorized and tacitly functionalist.
 While the literature as a whole does not always completely ignore other
 economic roles – such as land rent's role in business cycles and crises;
 in wages, unemployment, and income distribution; or in globalization, finance,
 and international trade – the vagueness of the question solicits answers
 that can be completely irrelevant to

 Even worse, it creates space for land-rent theories that go beyond having
 nothing so say about such things and are demonstrably wrong when confronted
 with such economic issues.

First, consider the conventional historiography's treatment of time and
 space, history and geography.
 Virtually all contemporary histories of land-rent theory draw exclusively
 from Western Europe or North America, and primarily use anglophone sources
 dating back not much earlier than James Anderson

Bourgeois society is the most developed and many-faceted historical

organisation
\lang english
 of production.
 The categories which express its relations, an understanding of its structure,
 therefore, provide, at the same time, an insight into the structure and
 the relations of production of all previous forms of society ....
 Some [components] of these remains [from earlier forms] are still dragged
 along within bourgeois society unassimilated, while elements which previously
 were barely indicated have developed and attained their full significance,
 etc.
 The anatomy of man is a key to the anatomy of the ape.
 On the other hand, indications of higher forms in the lower species of
 animals can only be understood when the higher forms themselves are already
 known.
 Bourgeois economy thus provides a key to that of antiquity, etc.
 ...
 One can understand tribute, tithe, etc., if one knows rent.
 But they must not be treated as identical.

Here he assumes a teleology of historical temporality, with successive forms
 of social organization being more developed and complex.
 In retrospect, such optimism, if one can call it that, seems hardly warranted
 and remarkably undialectical.
 Surely the structure and relations of previous forms of society, and of
 geographically separate forms of society, can also provide insight into
 the structure and relations of present-day Western society.
 And this applies to both transitive and intransitive dimensions of knowledge
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bhaskar1978arealist"

\end_inset

: investigations into earlier and/or geographically distinct forms of society,
 using both present-day categories and those of the other society – such
 as Marx's proposed study of tribute and tithes – have the potential to
 provide insights not only into the structure and relations of these other
 societies and their own conceptions of themselves (e.g., of tribute, tithe,
 etc.), but also into the structure and relations of present-day society
 and into the present-day conceptions (e.g., of rent) used to comprehend the
 present.
 Furthermore, at a time when human civilization seems to be careening towards
 some combination of political, economic, and ecological calamity, broadening
 the scope of land-rent research beyond Western modernity holds the promise
 of inspiring new models and policies that may stave off the apocalypse.

 recent study of Singapore is a step in the right direction, although I
 would appreciate a longer history than Haila's brief one, which starts
 in the late colonial period.
 A review of landownership and rent practices in ancient areas dominated
 by Indian and Chinese culture and states, tracing them to the present,
 would help identify the historical roots of contemporary Singapore and
 distinguish what is indigenous from what is imported, what is traditional
 from what is modern.
 I would also welcome more comparative work to help sort through these thorny
 threads.

 How much influence did foreign hacking have on voters? Social media, hacking,

 election would have had a different outcome.
 And, as ongoing investigations demonstrate, everything that happened during

 did infiltrate economics, but as an archapelego of heterodox outposts in
 rebellion against the imperial mainstream, typically having more influence
 outside the parent discipline than within it

 of rigid structuralism, economism, and neglect of human subjectivity and

Meanwhile, economics followed an altogether different path.
 Urban economics was a popular and rather strong subfield during the late

Faced with such divergence, it is remarkable that the conventional historiograph
y all but ignores the mainstream path.
 This is not an endorsement of returning to Alonso and neoclassical models
 of land rent: if anything, criticisms that put neoclassical land-rent theory
 in such disfavor during the 1970s are even stronger now.
 But this does demonstrate the blinders on the conventional historiography
 and foretell an upcoming clash between theories of land-rent theory based
 in geographical political economy versus geographical economics.
 It may also be a symptom of how much – despite the fracturing, tribalism,
 and neglect – geographical political economy continues to be

In fact, the argument for emphasizing Marx is even stronger for land-rent
 than it is for economic geography as a whole.
 Although the origins of the discipline of geography can be traced to the
 early nineteenth century, the subfield of economic geography did not take
 shape until around the turn of the twentieth century, and especially during
 the mid-twentieth century

 So it is unsurprising that histories of land-rent correlate with histories
 of their parent subfields of urban and economic geography.

many geographers [expressed deep concern] about what was felt to be the
 increasingly structuralist and economistic turn ....
 The result was ...
 a barage of critical commentaries calling for a geography that was less
 inclined to interpret spatial forms as unmediated outcomes of the logic
 of macro-social structures (above all, some ahistorical logic of capital)
 ...
 more open to he force of human intentionality and sensitive to ...
 [various] political experiences and forms of action ...
 as much [concern with] ...
 the role of gender as of class ....
 More generally, structuralist Marxism offered a framework of analysis that
 was judged insufficiently open-ended and insufficiently alert to the notion
