Examples for a Research Program
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some examples here will illustrate the potential of breaking down such walls
 and joining land-rent theory with currently disconnected subjects.
 These examples will also demonstrate the kind of research associated with
 a research program focused on the goal of broad theoretical coherence and
 will provide a nascent road map for reviving land-rent theory within such
 a program.
 Among the examples, some apply anywhere, while others have global scale.
 But some only make sense within the context of an individual, existing
 nation state.
 For these I use examples from the United States: because space limitations
 preclude discussion of multiple sets of examples, with each set pertaining
 to specific national circumstances; because situating such examples within
 a single national context highlights synergies and complementarities between
 the examples, thereby demonstrating the potential richness of an integrative
 research program such as the one advocated here and because I am most familiar
 with the U.S.
 So for illustration, take just three topics commonly studied outside economic
 geography – the political economy of labor, value theory, and speculative
 asset investment – and consider how they may be combined with land-rent
 theory.

Several social science disciplines study the political economy of labor,
 while research on value theory or speculative asset investment is primarily
 located in heterodox economics.

Start with labor.
 Here research on minimum-wage legislation is the low-hanging fruit.
 Heterodox economists have used geographical data on adjacent jurisdictions
 to study changes when one jurisdiction increases its minimum wage but the
 other does not

; they find that modest increases in the minimum wage are associated with
 reduced employment flows (e.g., separations) but not stocks (e.g., employment
 levels).

This research is heavily empirical and – to influence policy – uses language
 with purchase in mainstream economics.
 Although all empirical research necessarily involves theory, empirical
 findings can based on one theoretical framework can sometimes be reinterpreted
 within another.
 Throughout this paper I sometimes employ findings from mainstream economics
 (on land values, on collateral effects, etc.) this way.
 For a more explicitly heterodox discussion of minimum wages and a critique
 of mainstream theory, see

considers the state of the art to be best exemplified by this geographically
 based, heterodox research.

\begin_layout Standard
How can land-rent research tie into this? On one hand, if workers on one
 side of a political boundary earn more due to minimum-wage legislation,
 then location in the higher-paying jurisdiction is valuable to them, and
 accordingly residential locations for minimum-wage workers in the jurisdiction
 may command higher rents.
 Conversely, if employers obtain a lower rate of profit in high-wage areas
 due to higher labor costs, then one would expect commercial land values
 and rents to be lower than in jurisdictions with lower minimum-wage levels.

Actually, a substantial body of research finds modest minimum wage increases
 often correlate with

 Land-rent theory suggests that spatial differences in wages and profits
 due to minimum-wage legislation would be reflected, at least in part, by
 differences in land values and rent due to legislated wage differences.

Another concern stems from the Crisis of the Early Twenty-First Century,
 or what for the sake of brevity I shall refer to here as

\begin_layout Standard
A third concern is closely related to the crisis and the inadequacy of most
 analyses of it with regard to the role of land-rent: land-rent theory's
 preoccupation with micro- and meso-level mechanisms of rent extraction
 and distribution and its almost complete neglect of land rent as a macroeconomi
c and macro-geographical process.
