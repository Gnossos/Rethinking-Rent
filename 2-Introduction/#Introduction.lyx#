Compared to that of their colleagues in the natural sciences, the relation
 between social scientists and the world outside academia is extremely problemat
ic.
 When astrophysicists successfully observed gravitational waves recently,
 as Einstein's theory of general relativity had predicted over a century
 ago, it was cause for celebration.
 But when the world capitalist system went into a global crisis in 2007-2008,
 as Marx's theory of capital had predicted about a century and a half ago,
 the reaction was quite different.
 A global crisis is not something to celebrate, of course, and just about
 five months after U.S.
 president George W.
 Bush announced the crisis on national television,

), heads of state did not denounce them as charlatans, throw them out them
 out from their temples of power, and replace them with Marxists, Georgists,
 post-Keynesians, or Minskyians.
 In fact, despite its intellectual success, critical political economy fared
 far worse.
 Amplified by waves of refugees from the war-torn Middle East and by barbaric
 jhadi terrorism, right-wing nationalism combined with reaction to the crisis,
 leading to the rise Trump, May, and others whose policies exactly opposite
 what social scientists who had diagnosed the crisis would have recommended.
