Ontology of Land Rent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see why this is likely to be so, a brief review of the history of land-rent
 theory within the larger context of Anglophone economic geography since
 the mid-twentieth century will be helpful.
 Considering land-rent theory within this larger context will also provide
 insight into how the theory came to its current dereliction.
 Doing so will also be helpful to proposals for moving land-rent theory
 forward insofar as they should be aware of this history, take the current
 context into account, and try to avoid mistakes of the past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Straddling World War II, the dominant approach to geography as a whole in
 the early postwar period saw the discipline to be akin to history: instead
 of studying particular kinds of phenomena, historical sciences were thought
 to study diverse phenomena clustered in time, and spatial sciences similarly
 studied diverse phenomena clustered in space

.
 As such, geography's main task was to study distinct areas, often by breaking
 things down around specific phenomena (e.g.
 climate or economy).
 Occasionally geographers would also study relations between areas.
 Any generic concepts or general principles would arise from the body of
 diverse areal studies, and their value, if any, would be proven by their
 usefulness in application to subsequent areal studies.
 But in the mid-1950s, this regional-descriptive understanding of the discipline
 began to be challenged by a nomothetic one.
 With strong roots in urban and economic geography, this view emphasized
 theory-building and a search for general laws of spatial organization

 Combined with the growing availability of digital computers, this gave
 rise to the quantitative revolution in geography, which dominated the field
 until the early 1970s.

\begin_layout Standard
For roughly two decades – between the early 1970s and the early 1990s –
 a Marxist variant of critical political economy was the dominant paradigm
 in economic geography 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scott07economic"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This approach came under increasing criticism during the 1980s, and although
 they never refuted it on its own terms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "83"
key "sayer1liberalism"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, by the early 1990s critics had successfully mounted a two-pronged attack
 on it.
 They made a convincing case that actually existing capitalism is much more
 varied and flexible than what the traditional Marxist theory of the capitalist
 mode of production portrays and therefore that this theory is insufficient
 for some of the most important issues of the day.
 Instead, the field began to emphasize 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

middle-range theory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 focusing on capitalism's varied forms and processes.
 On a second front, critics identified axes of inequality and domination
 – such as gender or race – that Marxist political economy seemed unable
 to address with much success.
 This critique brought formerly peripheral axes of inequality and domination
 to the center of economic geography, supplanting formerly central concerns,
 most notably class.
 The net result was a shift in economic geography away from the received
 canons of the Marxist tradition, with its emphasis on big, geohistorical
 issues, and to theories aimed at a smaller scale, with more reliance on
 more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

local
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and varied investigations, and to a wider variety of research topics with
 virtually no cohesive framework to tie everything together.
 As a result, the field became fragmented, atomized, and isolated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "peck2012economic"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The very same fragmentation gave the field a tribal character, with each

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 turning inward, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transfixed by its own theoretical eccentricities,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and away from each other, away from developments outside economic geography,
 and away from the big issues of the day

 Today the field remains mostly critical of and opposed to mainstream economics,
 and it frequently borrowed from the Marxist tradition, but in an ad hoc
 way.

 Nonetheless, economic geography is tied together only by weak theoretical
 threads and lacks a cohesive, unifying theoretical framework.

As one might expect, the specific subject of land rent tracked this path
 very closely.
 Between the early 1970s and early 1990s it garnered considerable attention
 and was the topic of intense debate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "for a review"

 But the seeds of division and discord were already visible 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kerr1996thetheory,haila1990thetheory"

\end_inset

, and shortly thereafter economic geography's study of land rent underwent
 a period of

rupture

 and decline

 What was left of it also became more isolated from the discipline of economics,
 even heterodox economics.
 This was no great shakes because heterodox economics itself had turned
 away from land rent

attribute this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

state of dilapidation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to three problem.
 First, scholars working on land rent failed to retain land rent as an economic
 category (ostensibly one with its own dynamics) apart from the inevitable
 contingent mediations present in any concrete situation.
 Second, because the Marxist tradition (at the time) made a strong distinction
 between value and price, geographical political economists never developed
 a mechanism for setting land prices similar to the bid-rent function in
 mainstream economics.
 Instead, researchers posited a class of landlords that functioned to set
 rent levels.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Instead of connecting their research to macro-level analyses and theories
 of the land-market, researcher have tended to adopt ...
 the rent categories as [a] political heuristic to expose extractive power
 relations within an institutional analysis ...
 or obfuscated the issue of rent altogether.

 What accounts for this recent interest in land rent? The cited sources
 all give their own reasons for advocating a return to land rent, but in
 light of the most cataclysmic economic event of our time, the Crisis of
 the early 21st Century, one might hope this would be a prime motive

 But surprisingly, it is not.
