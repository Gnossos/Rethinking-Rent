\begin_layout Section
The Supply of Land
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section examines the supply of land.
 To some readers the very idea of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the supply of land
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 may seem strange, almost an oxymoron, because the currently conventional
 view holds that the supply of land is fixed and permanent.
 Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Is-Supply-Fixed"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 addresses this question by using historical evidence from Boston and Coastal
 Louisiana to refute this dogma and to develop some rudamentary ways of
 thinking about land supply as variable.
 In turn, this slips into a discussion of usable land in Subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Usable-Land"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 If land can be produced and supplied, then does it make any sense at all
 to distinguish land rent from ordinary capitalist profit? Section
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "subsec:Land-Supply,-Rent,"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 takes this up by calling particular attention to the importance of time
 in the relation between land supply and land rent.
 The concluding section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "subsec:Land-and-Crises"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 builds on this and discusses some relations between land, rent, and crises.

Is Land Supply Permanetly Fixed?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1901 Frank 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
after "417"
key "fetter1901thepassing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 summarized what he called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conventional view
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of land rent by quoting Alfred Marshall, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The income derived from the ownership of land and other free gifts of nature
 is called rent.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Thus, in the conventional view the distinction between capital and land
 is that capital consists of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

material things which owe their usefulness to human labour ...
 and those which owe nothing to it being classed as land.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 A page later, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
after "418"
key "fetter1901thepassing"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 points to problems in this view: (1) distinguishing between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nature's gifts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and products of human labor is practically impossible and (2) this particular
 distinction between land and capital is useless to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the practical business man.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Fetter suggests defenders of the conventional view evade such problems
 by moving the goalposts: from nature's free gifts to the equally problematic
 notion that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

land is a fixed stock for all time, while capital is not.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite Fetter's trenchant critique of Marshall, both men approached the
 subject of land rent within the marginalist framework that had launched
 neoclassical economics scarcely twenty-five years earlier.
 Since then land rent has fragmented.
 Mainstream, neoclassical economists still rely on marginalism 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Virtually all contemporary land-rent theory presumes the supply of land
 is fixed and permanent, and that land itself is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

free gift of nature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 .
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 trace this belief at least as far back as the 18th century, to the work
 of the French physiocrats and classical economists, and use it to explain
 Ricardo's reliance on differential rent:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
A labour theory of value holds that the economic value of a commodity depends
 on how much labour must be spent in order to produce it.
 It follows from this theory that land cannot command a value in itself
 as it is 
\emph on
permanent and does not require labour to produce
\emph default
 [my italics].
 Ricardo's ([1817]2004) solution was to bring rent theory into accordance
 with the labour theory of value using the notion of 'differential rent'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But if the supply of land is neither fixed nor permanent, and more importantly
 if human labor can increase or decrease the supply of land, produce land
 or destroy it, then a labor theory of value does not require differential
 rent, and the latter is therefore is a digression.

Which is not to say the concept of differential rent is completely worthless.
 In other contexts it may in fact be quite useful.

 landowners hold land back from the market, letting some land sit vacant,
 in order to realize monopoly rents.
 Still others, like

 But Ricardo's notion of an extensive margin implies variability in the
 supply of land.
